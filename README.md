## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a **hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** with **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** to create an adaptive, context-aware cyber defense system.  
Unlike conventional IDS solutions that rely on static rule sets or manually updated signatures, this system learns dynamically from network traffic data and real-time vulnerability intelligence feeds such as the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** database, **ThreatMiner**, and **AlienVault OTX**.

The system aims to **detect both known and unknown cyberattacks** while minimizing false positives and improving recall through OSINT integration.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Develop a **Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** capable of identifying and classifying cyberattacks.  
2. Integrate **real-time OSINT** data (CVE, ThreatMiner, AlienVault OTX) into the model for enhanced situational awareness.  
3. Evaluate multiple ML models — **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** — for performance and interpretability.  
4. Improve model **recall and adaptability** using OSINT-driven features.  
5. Deploy and validate the system using benchmark datasets (**KDD Cup 99**, **CICIDS 2017**) and simulated traffic.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Machine Learning Integration** — supervised models trained on benchmark intrusion datasets.  
- **OSINT Fusion** — live intelligence feeds from ThreatMiner and AlienVault OTX for contextual learning.  
- **Dynamic CVE Ingestion Module** — Python-based script that automates CVE data collection and processing.  
- **Enhanced Feature Space** — inclusion of vulnerability-related metadata (e.g., exploitability, CVSS score).  
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
  - ROC-AUC and PR-AUC curves  
  - Confusion Matrices and Feature Importance visualizations
